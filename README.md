Timer Rank Challenge
This project is a React-based web application built with Vite, where users are challenged to start and stop timers as close as possible to a target time. The closer the user stops the timer to the actual target time, the higher their rank, which ranges from 0 to 100.

Features:
Start and stop a timer at any time before it expires.
Get a rank between 0-100 based on how close the stop time is to the target time.
Real-time feedback to track performance.
